						<p>
							<i>"Stranded"</i> is a Roblox horror and adventure game that I started working on back in 2020.
							I have always been a fan of everything horror. The suspense, the music, the thrill, the mystery, the characters, all of it was fascinating to me.
							Everything about the horror genre motivated me to make something that would allow players to experience something new.
							I wanted people to understand the passion I have for things that make a genre like horror unique.
							
							<br /><br />
							Before Stranded, I had some experience working on other projects on Roblox (some of which can be seen <a data-scrolly href="roblox.html" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>).
							However, I felt that nothing I had made or been a part of really showcased my skills as a builder, coder, designer, and storyteller.
							I wanted to create something original, exciting, and entirely from the ground up.
							So, I abandoned everything I had worked on up to that point. I wanted to create a game that told a story.
							As time went on, I took the opportunity to turn this project into a learning experience.
							Going into the development of Stranded, I did not know how to code.

							<br /><br />
							As of 2024, I have been able to learn a lot that the Lua programming language has to offer.
							I have practiced my building and design skills over and over,
							and have been extremely grateful for the platform that Roblox has given me to be able to create something that I can be proud of.
							I have taken a lot of inspiration from other games and movies for this project.
							However, the game is still a work in progress and nothing on this page is final.
							
							<br /><br />
							I began working on Stranded before generative AI tools became widely used.
							My main motivation for this project was to challenge myself and see what I could create, not to have something generate my ideas for me.
							I believe that AI can be a useful tool for things like programming and processing data, but I do not think that people should rely on it.
							AI lacks the depth of emotional understanding and subjective interpretation that people bring to their creative ideas.

								The intro to Stranded is the very first cinematic I designed for the game.
								I wanted to create a cutscene that was synced to a soundtrack.
								I began working on it very early, probably going through it more than 100 times to make sure everything was exactly how I wanted it.
								Every character animation was made using the Live Animation Creator feature in Roblox Studio.
								I believe the most important part of a game is how it begins.
								When a player first joins the game, I wanted to grab their attention by having them directly involved in the story.
								Every player sees their own character in each of the cutscenes.

								When someone joins the game for the first time, the intro plays before they are redirected to the game menu.
								The code above checks to see if a player has completed the intro, and then calls onto a module known as the Cutscenes module to run a specific function.
								If a player has played before, they are redirected to the menu with an option that allows them to replay the intro.
								If a player hasn't played before, they must first complete the intro before they can be brought to the menu.
								After completing the intro, the <i>CompletedIntro1</i> value is then set to true and saved by a DataStore.

								I wanted to give Stranded's menu a lot of background detail.
								Players are able to go straight into the lobby by pressing <i>"New Game"</i> or <i>"Continue"</i>,
								gain some information about the game by pressing <i>"Information"</i>,
								see the game credits by pressing <i>"Credits"</i>,
								or replay the intro by pressing <i>"Replay Intro"</i>.
								There are a total of 15 songs that each have a chance of playing every time a player visits the menu.
								The lack of color in the menu is intentional.
								Every player sees their own character sitting on the hill.

								Here is a basic setup of how the Cutscenes module is structured.
								Each of the variables are accessed from both module functions,
								as both the menu and intro deal with elements from <i>Players</i>, <i>Lighting</i>, <i>TweenService</i>, <i>UserInputService</i>, <i>ReplicatedStorage</i>, and <i>Debris</i>.
								The <i>CameraShaker</i> and <i>GlobalFunctions</i> modules are accessed as well.
								The <i>GlobalFunctions</i> module is a module that I created that takes care of disabling a player's movements, resetting the game's lighting, muting specific sounds, and more.
								While both module functions have a considerable amount of code in each, the intro has a lot more.
								The amount of code required in a cutscene module function depends on the length of the cutscene.

							<p style="font-size: 14pt;">
								Ever since Roblox allowed users to edit their own avatar's height and scale,
								one of the greatest challenges I faced when creating this game was determining a player's height.
								Because I was using a very specific position for a character's model in each cutscene of the intro (which I label as a <i>FixCheck</i>), a player's character would sometimes be too low in the ground for being too tall or too high above the ground for being too short.
								In the Cutscenes module, there is a variable <i>"Default"</i> that has a very specific number assigned to it.
								This number is the exact height of a default block avatar rig.
								In both of the module functions, a formula is used to calculate a player's height based on their <i>BodyHeightScale</i>, <i>BodyTypeScale</i>, and <i>BodyProportionScale</i>.
								Then, each cutscene position (<i>FixCheck</i>) is adjusted based on whether the player's avatar is taller or shorter than the default value.
								The code above is an example of how this process is done for the player's character position in the menu.

								I took heavy inspiration from Dev Rel Development's <a data-scrolly href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6225076142/8th-Annual-Bloxy-Awards" target="_blank"><i>8th Annual Bloxy Awards</i></a>.
								The Agency consists of multiple sectors, including the Main Hall, Artifact Gallery, Entity Chambers, Offices, Corridors, and the Core.
								I have spent many years putting this lobby together, and it is arguably one of my best builds.

								As you can see, there are many similarities between the lobby I designed and the lobby I took inspiration from.
								I wanted to expand on this design and make The Agency extremely large in order to encourage players to explore.
								I have always been a fan of adventure and exploration games on Roblox, especially the 2017 and 2018 Egg Hunts.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are a total of 35 lobby soundtracks that each have a random chance of playing in rotation once a player enters the lobby.
								When music plays, the speakers around the facility pulse to the beat of whichever soundtrack is playing.
								Similar to Dev Rel Development's lobby, announcements with random hints play over the lobby intercom, while also muffling any background music while being played.
								Coins are scattered throughout many of the different sectors, rewarding those who enjoy exploring.
								There are many secrets to find and quests to complete in the Agency.
								Randomly-generated NPCs that players can interact with also roam around the lobby, allowing players to also complete side quests.

								Aezamund, the Enchanted Woodlands is easily one of my favorite realms that I've put together.

								I wanted to create a dimension that was centered around one of the characters I designed, which we will get to in the next section.
								There were many particles and sounds that I used to try to make this level feel really magical.
								But, considering that this is a horror experience, this enchanted forest might not be as benevolent as it seems.

								Realm of the 9 Portals is undeniably one of the best horror games I have ever played.
								The second realm is a personal favorite of mine, simply because of how scary it is.
								Roblox horror games today often involve being chased inside of a maze.
								I believe this game is one of the first horror games that popularized that concept on Roblox.

								Leader of The Agency.
								Agent Zen's ultimate goal is to put an end to Stranded's antagonism by containing all potentially dangerous entities from other worlds before Stranded can use them to cause irreversible damage to his world.
								<br />
								<br />
								This character was inspired by my main Roblox account.
								I have always been interested in things like secret agents and espionage, so I wanted my character to resemble something similar to those themes.
								I also wanted to have a character that could lead players and explain their objective to them.
								A lot of horror games that I have played on Roblox don't give a whole lot of context or details on what to do or how to get to the next level, which can be frustrating.

								When players collect certain artifacts or contain certain entities, they will be able to inspect them and see information like where they were found,
								the date they were collected, and a description of the item or entity that was collected.
								If a player hasn't yet contained or collected an artifact, question marks appear in place of each piece of information.
								Lock symbols also appear on uncontained entity tubes indicating that a specific entity still needs to be contained.

								Randomly-generated male and female NPCs roam around The Agency, allowing players to interact with them to get a random dialogue.
								Some of them also allow players to accept certain quests to complete for additional coins and XP.
								There are 5 categories of NPCs: Pistol, Rifle, Crate, Clipboard, and Radio.
								Clicking during a NPC's dialogue skips the typewriting animation to the end of the dialogue.

								Despite Stranded being a solo project, I had help in certain areas from some of my friends.
								For example, a few of them assisted me with coding issues I ran into, while others helped me with coming up with a unique and immersive story.
								I listed all of the main contributors and studios I took inspiration from in the credits.

								Back in 2018 and 2019, mysterious games known as "Roblox Myths" were an extremely popular subgenre on Roblox.
								Myth hunters loved to solve puzzles and unravel the hidden stories behind the creators of these places.
								I enjoyed exploring myth games myself, so I was motivated to make my own after discovering one of my accounts with the name <a data-scrolly href="https://www.roblox.com/users/81033091/profile" target="_blank"><i>StrandedBeneath</i></a>.

								I ended up making about a dozen of creepy places surrounded by this persona in order to attract players that loved a good mystery.
								The main game consisted of a log cabin in the middle of some snowy woods with a few puzzles that players could go around and solve.
								Although the game was extremely basic, especially for a myth game, I had a lot of fun messing around with all sorts of horror elements.

								While the myth games I made were never extremely popular, they did gain some traction in the myth hunting community.
								One myth hunter named <a data-scrolly href="https://www.roblox.com/users/612920931/profile" target="_blank"><i>Detective_Phillips</i></a>
							 	documented a few clues in a game of his (<a data-scrolly href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2128086882/P-B-Private-Investigation-Services" target="_blank"><i>P&B Private Investigation Services</i></a>) that were related to the myth games that I made.
								Another hunter named <a data-scrolly href="https://www.roblox.com/users/480930148/profile" target="_blank"><i>I_nsomniac</i></a> drew some fan art of the persona I made.
								It was little instances like these that made me want to expand on this idea and create a fully fleshed out horror experience and see what else I was capable of creating.

								Over the next few years, I came up with a few rough designs of what I wanted my horror game to look like.
								I still wanted to include a lot of the same elements as my original myth games, such as the masked persona and the black and white saturation, but I also wanted to create something that would appeal to those that aren't very familiar with Roblox myths.
								I wanted to create a more immersive experience for people.
								However, I still wanted to allow for a sense of mystery to the story.
								Ultimately, I wanted to create something that was interesting but also did justice to my original ideas.

								After deciding to expand my myth games into a horror game, I had the opportunity to practice more things like character and scene design.
								The Watcher and Queen Azalea were the first entities I made for Stranded, and some of their earliest designs can be seen in the images on the right.
								I hope that one day players will grow to love and resonate with the characters that were made for this game.

								That's about it for Stranded.
								This project is my proudest creation, as it has allowed me to grow as a designer, builder, programmer, and storyteller.
								I have big plans for this game despite a lot of it still being incomplete.
								I will be forever grateful to my friends and fans that have supported me over the years, especially those who have watched me give up on old projects to pursue this one.
